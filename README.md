This is a ticker macro for google docs.

If you want to use live bitcoin cash->USD exchange rates in your google document, you can use this macro. Currently written for USD rates but can easily be modified for Euro or any other currency.

It uses the coinmarketcap API. It will cache the rate to avoid hitting the servers repeatedly.
